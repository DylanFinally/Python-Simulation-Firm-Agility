This second iteration allows the firmÂ´s belief of matching the state to adjust according to the position within the "game". 
Each period in which the firm fails to acquire a large payout, the belief of matching the state decreases. 
This belief structure follows a particular path which has been difficult to replicate. 
As such, a geometric approximation has been used which nears the actual belief structure. 
The approximation deviates from the actual belief by around 20%. 
While this may warrant concern, when dealing with beliefs over successive periods in which the firm continues to "miss", such deviations occur in the .0000th percentiles.
The functional results are nearly identical, despite such deviation.

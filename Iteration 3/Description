The third iteration solves the backward induction "game tree" of the agility model. 
It contains and captures all possible value functions including continuation values. 
Inner maximization functions are recorded and captured. 
A spreadsheet of 1s and 0s is populated indicating when the firm would engage in a reorganization or not, at any possible node and any possible period. 
This spreadsheet is loaded by the simulation. 
Whenever the simulation is prompted with a potential reorganization, in the case that only a small payoff is received, the spreadsheet will be checked for the appropriate decision. 
The simulation then proceeds. 
Just as in the second iteration of the model, a geometric approximation is used to replicate Bayes Theorem which captures declining probability beliefs in matching the state.

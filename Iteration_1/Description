"""
The first iteration of the model features a simulation that extends to any number of periods. 
However, it is incomplete.
The belief stucture, which should change depending on the individual payoffs, remains constant. 
Furthermore, the mechanism which governs decision making is fixed and determined at the beginning of the simulation.

The fourth iteration features a correction on the state switch mechanism. 
Previous renditions of the simulation only allowed the state to switch to either zero or one. 
I had argued that this binary configuration reflected real world movements in either an upward / growth or downward / contractionary direction.
However, I failed to recognize that such a configuration violated the calculated value functions with continuation values. 
In the original model, whenever a state switch occured, it was impossible for the firm to maintain a matching product variety.
If the state switch can only take two values, either zero or one, then even when the state switch has occured it may have been that the firm engaged in a successful match. 
This would in turn completely change value functions. 

In this iteration, we follow the binary configuration, if a one is rolled, with a random draw from 10,000. 
The result of this random draw of 10,000 becomes the state switch "identity" for the given period. 
Instead of simply 0 and 1, product variety can now also take on a number between 1 and 10,000.
10,000 has been arbitrarily chosen since in the model, the state switch takes on any real number.
